# The Corleone family network
This project is the first part of my mini-series on social network analysis. The goal of this series is to start with the very basics of network analysis, such as with the concepts of centrality and assortativity, and progress towards more advanced topics, including Erdős-Rényi and Configuration models, as well as Exponential family random graphs. In this first project, I am analyzing the network of **Corleone family**, as outlined in **The Godfather (1972)** film directed by Coppola and co-written by Mario Puzo. I depict the Corleone Sicilian mafia network based on characters' **on-camera dialogues/appearances**.
